// Create a Student and a Classroom Class
// When the class is instantiated it should have a name, favoriteSubject, and gpa that
// we can pass into it during instantiation
// Also create a studentDescribe method that if name is 'Joe' favoriteSubject is 'science' and gpa is 4.0' it should log:
//('Joe favorite subject is science. Joe has a gpa of 4.0.)
// In your Classroom class
// Create an empty array where we can add students
// Also create a professor and roomNumber property
// Create a classDescribe method that, if professor is "Professor Johnson", roomNumber is '417' and the number of students is 12,  will log, for example:
// "Professor Johnson's class is in room 417. Professor Johnson has 12 students "
// create a method called addStudent that can add a student to the students array
// create a studentCount method that if there are 5 students logs, for example:
// 'There are 5 students in the class'
// create a method called studentNames in the Classroom class
// It should log each name of the students in the classroom one by one.

// Create two new Student instances and give them values. They should be called called student1 and student2
// Describe each student by logging them with your method.
// Create a new Classroom instance called firstClass and add values.
// Add the two students to the new classroom
// Use your method to describe the class
// change the name of student one to Peter using your instantiated student2
// Call firstClass and Chain the studentCount and studentNames methods
